					# Storybook
					## Or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the component

					Ryan Parsley

					09/13/18
					Notes:
					I've been using a library called Storybook to automatically generate a component library for the chat bot I've been working on. I'd like to introduce you to what it does and make a case why more projects  that we work on should probably use it or something like it.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# What is storybook!?

					> The UI Development Environment You'll ♥️ to use &mdash;[the project's landing page](https://storybook.js.org/)

					Notes:
					* Perhaps to call it a tool for generating a component library is not doing it justice.
					* The impact of using Storybook is bigger than checking off a deliverable requirement. It helps make better code, and communicate about your code more easily.
					* Integrates with:
					* React
					* Vue
					* Angular
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Build durable documented UI faster

					Notes:
					* Observing components in isolation
					* Easily manipulate data
					* Provides a documentation pattern
					* Clues for future developers
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## What's it look like?

					![storybook](/img/storybook.png)

					Notes:
					* Three panes:
						* Navigation
						* Preview
						* Meta data
					* You can run it in dev mode so it live reloads as you work
					* You can build it as a static site

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## What does configuration look like?

					```
					import { configure } from '@storybook/vue'

					const req = require.context(
						'../components',
						true,
						/\.stories\.js$/)

					function loadStories () {
						req.keys().forEach((filename) => req(filename))
					}

					configure(loadStories, module)
					```

					Notes:
					I'd say fairly minimal considering what you get
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## What does a story look like under the hood?
					```
					storiesOf('introContent', module)
						.addDecorator(withReadme(readme))
						.add('intro content as component', () => ({
							store: store,
							components: { introContent },
							template: '<introContent/>'
						}))
					```
					Notes:
					If you squint your eyes, it kind of looks like a unit test.

					We'll circle back to addDecorator(), but look at the following

					* storiesOf is akin to Describe
					* add is like an it block
					* Instead of making assertions, we render the component
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					##  Configurable via `Addons`
					* Action Logger
					* Knobs
					* Tests
					* Readme
					* Viewport
					```
					storiesOf('introContent', module)
						.addDecorator(withReadme(readme))
						.add('intro content as component', () => ({
							store: store,
							components: { introContent },
							template: '<introContent/>'
						}))
					```
					Notes:
					Addons provide more meta info about your component.

					In this example, addDecorator(withReadme()) declares we want to display a readme file in a tab.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## What does this *actually* communicate?
					![storybook](/img/coverageBefore.png)

					Notes:
					On the topic of exposing useful information to non-developers...

					Coverage reports can be exposed to non-developers via tools like SonarQube, but is this a good way to communicate... anything?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Unit test integration
					![storybook](/img/unitTestIntegration.png)

					Notes:
					More humane *and* contextually relevant
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Action Logger
					```
					methods: {
					onSend: action('onSend')
					},
					```
					![storybook](/img/actionLogger.png)
					Notes:
					Friends don't let friends commit console logs.

					Sometimes they've felt like the best way to communicate intent, this is better.

					Keep those notes in the story and out of your component's source code.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## knobs
					![storybook](/img/knobs.png)
					```
					mockMessage: {
						message: 'Dinner will be here before you can say sizzle. Want some quick grilling.',
						options: array('Options', ['Yep', 'Nope']),
						sender: 'chuck'
					}
					```

					Notes:
					Live updates of data manipulation:
					* Does a long title break layout on mobile?
					* Easily demonstrate UI changes based on data
						* 2 options look different than 3 options in this instance
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Readme
					![storybook](/img/readme.png)

					Notes:
					Documentation is good. Often, we miss a trick when we can't share this outside of the developer silo.
