					# Storybook
					## Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the component library
					Ryan Parsley
					Notes:
						I've been using a library called Storybook to automatically generate a component library for the chat bot I've been working on. I'd like to introduce you to what it does and make a case why more projects  that we work on should probably use it or something like it.

					# What is storybook!?
					> The UI Development Environment You'll ♥️ to use &mdash;[the project's landing page](https://storybook.js.org/)
					Notes:
						Perhaps to call it a tool for generating a component library is not doing it justice. The impact of using Storybook is bigger than checking off a requirement. It helps make better code, and communicate about your code more easily.

						Easily integrates with React, Vue and Angular

							* You can build it as a static site
